title: The Backend Strikes Back
description: The best JS is (almost) no JS
---

Copilot wanted the description to be "the backend is the best end".  I can't disagree.

I've written many a portfolio site over the years.  

Or should I say... I've copy and pasted many a portfolio site.  The first was some crappy HTML site 
back in high school.  Then came the business-casual Bootstrap portfolio.  At some point, tailwind took 
over and I copy and pasted some of that.

All of them were horrible in their own way.  The first... well... actually the first was pretty awesome.  I remember
FTP'ing the He-man heyyeyaaeyaa song to the server and having a little bit of JavaScript that would play the song 
if the user entered the konomi code.  Yea I was that guy... 

But anyway... since that incredibly cool and popular peak, my interactions with JavaScript have steadily declined
into a sort of overwhelming confusing about the state of the industry... 

I'll skip over the rest of the JavaScript hate because if you're deep enough down the tech rabbit hole to have stumbled 
across my blog, you already know all the things I could say.  Suffice to say... I'm out, I'm officially done with JavaScript.

(Oh and that thing you call TypeScript... that's JavaScript)

And following that critical decision... a funny thing happened.  I fell back in love with web development.

I started to write this new portfolio, using a tech stack that I love, and, by god... it's awesome.  It's not "good" looking,
it's super lo-fi... and it doesn't _do_ much (yet)... but, it's mine.  I _actually_ made this.  I didn't copy and paste
huge swaths of React "components".  I didn't `npx create` anything.  I wrote this.  And maybe... _just_ maybe... I'll dig
into more about this site in a future post :)
